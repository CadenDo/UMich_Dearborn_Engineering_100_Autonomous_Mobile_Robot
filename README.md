Autonomous Mobile Robot Ranking: 1st place in Section 004 Lab and 1st place in ENGR 100 AMR Competition

Engineering 100 is an introduction to engineering design course at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. This is a semester-long project in which student groups are tasked with building an autonomous vehicle with an Arduino. The project aims for each team to create a unique design that simulates an autonomous vehicle in a warehouse environment to improve general safety, transport efficiency, and collision avoidance. 

One of the 6 section-winning teams from ENGR 100 presenting at the University of Michigan-Dearborn CECS Project-Based Learning Showcase on December 13th, 2024 from 11 AM to 1 PM. The final competition will be held during the showcase to see who's robot comes out on top!
